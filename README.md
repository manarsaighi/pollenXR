# XR Prototyping assignment proposal


PollenXR explores the vital role of insects in pollination, which is essential for the reproduction of flowering plants and in turn maintaing the biodiversity of our world. This XR experience supports the fifteenth Sustainable Development Goal: Life on Land. 

The player will be placed within a garden scene where they will be able to interact with pollinator insects like bees, butterflies and beetles using hand tracking gestures. The main mechanic will be a pointing gesture; the user can point at one insect at a time and lure the insect towards them. The user then guides the insect towards a nearby flower in the scene, completing the pollination event. When an insect successfully pollinates a flower, surrounding plants will bloom and the insect will have a yellow particle effect to represent pollen. A pollination counter will increase until the user has successfully guided all insects in the scene to a flower.
